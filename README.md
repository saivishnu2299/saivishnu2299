# 👋 Hi, I'm Sainath Krishnamurthy

I'm a designer, technologist, and researcher exploring how we interact with machines, emotions, and reality itself. My work investigates the emotional and philosophical dimensions of technology, with a focus on AI, haptics, and posthuman human-computer interaction.

I run **OpusLABS**, a research-driven studio that builds emotionally intelligent computing systems. I design tools that don't just process information—they *feel*. I'm currently focused on creating wearable technology that allows users to experience digital emotions as physical sensations.

## 🧪 What I Work On

### Opus – A Digital Epidermis for Emotional Feedback  
**Opus** is a wearable system that converts digital emotional content into real-time haptic feedback, worn as a compact patch on the back of the neck. It processes data from phone notifications, performs sentiment analysis using large language models, and translates the emotional context into expressive, localized haptic gestures.

- Built with a **Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3** microcontroller and **Adafruit DRV2605L** haptic motor drivers  
- Controlled via a minimal **iOS app** written in Swift using SwiftUI, integrated with **Bluetooth** for communication  
- Sentiment analysis is powered by **LLMs like GPT-4o**, with local processing planned for privacy  
- Full-stack system integrating **Python**, **C++**, **Objective-C**, and **Arduino firmware**

Opus bridges ambient computing, emotional AI, and wearable interaction design to create a new layer of digital self-awareness.

## 🔬 Research Interests

### Emotional Technology & Haptic Interfaces  
I'm interested in how digital emotion can be rendered into **tactile experiences**, creating new channels of communication and self-regulation. I believe emotional feedback systems will become core to post-screen interfaces and mental health tech.

### Posthumanism & the Extended Mind  
My work is rooted in the **Extended Mind Thesis**—the idea that cognition is not confined to the brain but distributed across tools, environments, and systems. I apply this to human-computer interaction by designing interfaces that **extend emotional and cognitive capacities** into digital systems.

### Wisdom, Trust, and Taste in the AGI Era  
I'm developing a framework around the idea that **taste**, **trust**, and **wisdom** are human qualities that remain relevant—even essential—as AI advances.

- **Taste** governs intuition, aesthetics, and judgment in the short term  
- **Trust** shapes relationships and reputations in the medium term  
- **Wisdom**—the deep integration of values, context, and experience—is the long-term moat

These ideas guide my work as a builder, researcher, and writer navigating the future of intelligence.

## 📡 Current Projects

- **Opus v1.3**: A sentiment-aware wearable system that transforms digital emotion into real-time haptic feedback. Currently testing expressive haptic patterns, local AI integration, and form factor improvements.
- **PromptBox**: A minimal prompt manager for LLM workflows, enabling fast testing and tagging of AI prompts across tasks.
- **Pointboard**: A custom-built tool and experimental interface for non-linear, visual thinking. Pointboard is designed to help me map relationships between ideas, questions, and intuitions—supporting slow, creative, and recursive reasoning across research domains. Built for my own practice, it offers a spatial canvas that resists linear productivity tools and embraces depth over speed.
- **Entangled Minds**: A philosophical research paper proposing a model of consciousness as an entangled, participatory field—blending insights from non-duality, quantum theory, and posthuman AI ethics.
- **BOOM**: An audio-reactive insole using low-frequency haptics to translate music into immersive foot-based sensation (early prototype from 2020).
- **Ubi**: A tracker system for last-mile logistics and geolocation data visualization (2021).
- **Sole**: A mobile app for sneaker discovery and culture, focused on intuitive UI and progressive information architecture (2022).

## 🧠 Writing & Philosophical Work

I write about technology not just as a tool, but as a medium of expression and evolution. My philosophical essays and research papers explore:

- The **posthuman condition** and the role of AI as cognitive infrastructure  
- **Non-dualism** and the continuity between self, world, and machine  
- The cognitive and emotional stakes of designing emotionally intelligent systems  
- **Ethics of sensory AI** and how we can design emotional systems that are intimate but respectful  

My approach blends Upanishadic philosophy, quantum thought, speculative fiction, and systems theory to develop new models for how intelligence and technology intertwine.

- Contributor to **TARKA Journal** by Embodied Philosophy  
- Member of the **Design and Posthumanism Network**  
- Developer of minimal tools for ambient AI interaction and LLM-powered workflows  
- Documentarian of process through **photography**, **street-style image-making**, and visual research

## ✍️ Ethos

> I believe the most meaningful interfaces are not louder or smarter—they're more **attuned**.  
> They listen. They respond with care. They respect attention, emotion, and time.

I'm here to explore new emotional grammars for machines. If you're working on something similar—or weird, or brave—let’s talk.
