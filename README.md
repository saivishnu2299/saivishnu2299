# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Sainath Krishnamurthy

Designer, technologist, and researcher at the intersection of AI, emotion, and human-machine interaction. I lead **OpusLABS**, where we explore how computing can feel, turning digital signals into meaningful, tactile experiences.

## What I‚Äôm Focused On

- **Opus**  
  A wearable ‚Äúdigital epidermis‚Äù that translates digital emotions into real-time haptic feedback.

- **OpusLABS**  
  An interdisciplinary studio that merges design, technology, philosophy, and research to create digital and physical product experiences that enrich users‚Äô lives.

## Core Interests

- **Emotional Technology and Haptics**  
  Crafting new channels for communication, self-regulation, and well-being. I investigate how subtle tactile cues can convey complex emotional states, support mental health, and foster deeper connections between people and devices.

- **Posthuman and Extended Mind**  
  Designing tools that extend cognitive and emotional capacities beyond the body. I explore how environments, wearables, and systems become active participants in our thought processes and daily experiences.

- **Human Qualities in AI**  
  Developing frameworks around taste, trust, and wisdom to guide AI evolution. I study how intuitive judgment, reliable relationships, and deep contextual understanding can shape more human-centered and ethically aligned intelligent systems.

I believe the most meaningful interfaces listen and respond with care, tuned to attention, emotion, and time. Let‚Äôs explore how technology can feel.
