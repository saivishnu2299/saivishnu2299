👋 Hi, I’m Sainath Krishnamurthy
Designer, technologist, and researcher at the intersection of AI, emotion, and human-machine interaction. I lead OpusLABS, where we explore how computing can feel—turning digital signals into meaningful, tactile experiences.

What I’m Focused On
	•	Opus: A wearable “digital epidermis” that translates digital emotions into real-time haptic feedback
	•	OpusLABS: An interdisciplinary studio that merges design, technology, philosophy, and research to create digital and physical product experiences to benefit users lives.
Core Interests
	•	Emotional Technology & Haptics: Crafting new channels for communication, self-regulation, and well-being
	•	Posthuman & Extended Mind: Designing tools that extend cognitive and emotional capacities beyond the body
	•	Human Qualities in AI: Developing frameworks around taste, trust, and wisdom to guide AI’s evolution

I believe the most meaningful interfaces listen and respond with care—attuned to attention, emotion, and time. Let’s explore how technology can feel.
